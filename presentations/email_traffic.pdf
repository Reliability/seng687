They did send us a Minitab file with some data for us to look at.  As I told
Jason shortly after they sent it, I do not have access to Minitab.  With it
being a .mpj project file, we can't use R or any other package to read in
the data either.  It was my understanding that Jason thought he had a way to
open the file and access the data and if he couldn't, he was going to inform
Bill LaPach that a different file structure would be needed.  

I haven't engaged since then and assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that Jason
was successful in opening the Minitab file.  

Other than following up on that, I was not aware of any other outstanding
actions from our end.  

Tom

Please correct me if I am wrong...

At the last meeting I remember they wanted some support from you two
regarding their math and some processes, potentially. Is that right?

I followed up with an email shortly after that and so did Andrew Porteous
but I have not heard anything either.

I don't have any outstanding actions in my tracker but I was not real clear
on who was doing what. My expectations were that the ball was in their court
to contact us/you with additional questions.

Mike,

Haven't heard or seen anything regarding support for the NWC reliability in
a while.  Anything new?

Per our telecom, attached you will find the J-Box SLE calculation (adjusted
after the date of the briefing file you received, for operational threshold
of 2.5 volts and 2% impact vs 10%).

I've also attached a Minitab file and a corrosion prediction calculation
file.

Also, for further clarification on the L10/B10 life.  The determination of
2% on any one subsystem is based on the likelihood of up to 4 subsystems
simultaneously presenting reliability erosion failure mechanisms (up to 2%
each) and a group of other emerging failure mechanisms across multiple
subsystems presenting a composite effect of an additional 2% (to total 10%
on the overall system).
